## Hey there üëã 

[![Ask Me Anything !](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ask%20me-anything-1abc9c.svg)](https://glukicov.github.io)

I am Gleb Lukicov, a machine learning engineer with a passion for **MLOps**. Visit [my homepage](https://glukicov.github.io) to read about my PhD research and ML projects. When I am not de-bugging my code, I am actively engaged in the [MLOps Community London](https://www.meetup.com/reproducibility-and-productivity-in-data-science/) as a co-host, üìù [tech blogging](https://medium.com/@lukicov), or üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <a href=https://glukicov.github.io/#interests>road cycling</a>. You can contact me for collaborations ideas or questions on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glukicov/).


The projects below contain analysis code used in my PhD thesis and personal ML projects:

#### 1. [`EDMTracking`](https://github.com/glukicov/EDMTracking) code to perform Fourier transforms and regression analysis on large datasets. 
The Muon <i>g ‚àí 2</i> experiment at Fermilab, near Chicago, [discovered a tantalising sign of New Physics (a new force of nature!)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-66407099). This was done by measuring a deviation between the experimental and theoretically predicted value of the muon magnetic anomaly. As part of my PhD, I collaborated on the experiment with 200 scientists and engineers. This project contains analysis code to measure the Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of the muon using the tracking detectors. The oscillation in the number of the observed tracks in the detector can be plotted and fitted, as shown below

#### 2. [`llm_pipelines_demo`](https://github.com/glukicov/llm_pipelines_demo?tab=readme-ov-file) End-to-end demo of local and remote pipelines with Kubeflow and Vertex AI.
Implementing local testing using Kubeflow Pipelines to shorten the development cycle using Docker cache, multi-stage builds, and dynamic user credentials injection. Also includes some infrastructure goodies like GitHub CI/CD & `pre-commit` config for *linting* and *testing*, local scripts with `typer`, project dependency management with `uv`, and static checking with `mypy`. This repo is a companion to [this blog post](https://medium.com/@lukicov/ml-pipelines-in-the-age-of-llms-from-local-containers-to-cloud-experiments-1b688dcebee5).

#### 3. [`CadenceAI`](https://github.com/glukicov/CadenceAI) Your AI-powered cycling companion üö¥üèª‚Äç‚ôÄü§ñÔ∏èüö¥‚Äç‚ôÇ
Did you know there are over 1 billion bicycles in the world? The cycling industry is entirely commoditised. However, helpful and personalised advice on training, repair and nutrition is out of reach for most people.  Introducing - **Cadence AI**, your all-in-one AI-powered cycling coach, mechanic, analyst and dietitian.

#### 4. [`ML_GPU`](https://github.com/glukicov/ML_GPU) contains personal practice ML code, and Deep Learning on GPUs using `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow` and `Keras`.

I wrote a practical guide on setting a personal GPU server for Machine Learning with Ubuntu 20.04 <a href=https://towardsdatascience.com/set-up-of-a-personal-gpu-server-for-machine-learning-with-ubuntu-20-04-100e787105ad target="_blank"> avaialbe on the Towards Data Science (TDS) website</a>.
